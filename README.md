# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-Dataset

📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to investigate factors that influenced passenger survival. The analysis involves data cleaning, statistical exploration, and visualizations to uncover meaningful insights.


📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

File Used: train.csv (contains survival labels and passenger details).
🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 3

NumPy → Numerical computations

Pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization

🔎 EDA Steps

Data Cleaning

Checked missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).

Verified data types (numerical and categorical).

Data Exploration

Summary statistics of numerical features.

Distribution of categorical variables.

Inspected survival rates across features.

Data Visualization

Survival rate by gender.

Survival rate by passenger class.

Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors.

Correlation heatmap of features.

📊 Key Insights

Women survived more often than men.

First-class passengers had a higher chance of survival than second and third class.

Children had better survival rates compared to adults.

Larger families had lower survival chances compared to smaller families.
